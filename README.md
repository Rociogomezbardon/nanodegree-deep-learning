# udacity-deep-learning
Repo with my exercises and projects of the udacity deep learning nanodegree. 

I will add more projects as I finish them during the course. 
There may be some missing projects or exercises that have not been added to this repository. 

To run the code in these projects, it is requred all the packages contained in the environment.yaml file. 
If you have docker installed, just create a new enviroment with the command:
"conda env create -f environment.yaml"

to remove enviroment use command:
"conda remove -n <name-of-environment> --all"
